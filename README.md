Kong PHP SDK
============

This PHP library integrates with the [Kong API](http://www.konghq.com), which is an open-source project of API Management.

The Kong by itself has their own RESTful API, and the library can nicely connect with Kong using PHP.

*The Kong endpoints are not completely covered as this project still in development.*

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Create a listener to handle the $config attribute on the Plugin model
- [ ] Develop the individual integration with plugins
